#### **When Merge Conflicts happen?**

When you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git cannot decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge, that's when merge conflicts happen.

#### **Resolving Conflicts:**

There are many ways to resolve conflicts on Git Merge. But we are going to use the easiest one. By using VSCode. Just Install VS Code in your system and open those files who have conflicts, and you will see 2 options: Current Change and Incoming change. Just like this.

Just choose Accept Incoming change. Save the file and commit the files by typing `git add .`, and `git commit -m “message”` . Now you have successfully merged 2 branches.

#### **Branch Management:**

We can create many branches in our repository and work in them. We also need to manage them. So let’s see few commands for managing branches in Git:

- To see all the branches you have created you will need to use this command : `git branch` and the current branch will have “*****” in front of the branch.
- To see Branches and that branch’s last commit along with its message type `git branch -v` and press enter.
- If you want to see which branches were merged then use `git branch --merged` and those that were not merged use “**git branch --unmerged**”.
- To delete a branch we need to use `git branch -d branchname`. Note that this command will fail if the branch we are deleting has not merged to the main branch. To tackle this error we will use `git branch -D branchname`, it will delete the branch even if it's not even merged yet.
