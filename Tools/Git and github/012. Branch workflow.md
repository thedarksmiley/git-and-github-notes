When people usually use git they create branches and primarily they create 2 types of branches.

##### <ins>**Long Running Branches:**</ins>

A long-running branch is a branch under active development that is not merged to the main branch for a long time. The main branch might be, for example, master or develop.

## <ins>**Topic Branches:**</ins>

Topic branch is a short lived branch which was created for a single particular feature or related work. Topic branches can be deleted after the particular feature is added to the project.

## **Example:**

### Letâ€™s assume you were working on a project where you have committed C1 on the master branch and then an issue has arised and to solve that issue you have created a new branch called issue and you have committed C2 and you came back to master to complete the work and committed C3 on master and went to the issue branch and committed C4, C5 and C6. When you were on C4 you came across another new issue and to fix that you have again created another new branch called Issue1 V2 and committed C7, C8 and C11 where you have solved that issue. After that you came to the Master branch and committed to C9, C10 and you got an idea. To implement the idea you created another branch named IDEA and committed C12 and C13. Now you want to Merge IDEA on to Master. Also you want to commit Issue1 V2 too. Now you have merged C11 of Issue1 V2 branch and C13 of IDEA branch and created a commit named C14 which is your master branch.
