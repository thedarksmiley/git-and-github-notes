==**Object Oriented Programming**==  
Object Oriented Programming is a programming model that deals with real world situations. It does so by dealing with objects and classes rather that function and logic. OOPs lets us reuse our code and also provide security in an efficient manner by using classes as object blueprints, that define the functional properties of those objects.

==**Objects**== objects are 

==**Classes**== c

==**Functions**== f

==**Methods**== m

==**Four Pillars of OOPS:**==

1.  **Abstraction**
2.  **Encapsulation**
3.  **Inheritance**
4.  **Polymorphism**
